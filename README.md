## Restaurateur

The most important part of being a restaurateur is learning that service is king. Your diners care the most about a good experience in your restaurant. Your job is to train your staff on how to speak to your patrons. To do this, you're going to build an app that allows them to experience being the diner.

### Let's Get Started

You'll be coding your solution in `js/waiter.js`. You'll want to use `prompt` and `alert` to greet you diners (when the page loads), ask them for their orders, etc. (all from the point of view of the server!)

Feel free to get creative here. Maybe instead of the questions and greeting being really polite, they're rude to show the servers how NOT to behave. It's all up to you!
